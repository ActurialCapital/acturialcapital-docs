# Porfolio Construction

Portfolio construction, which involves translating scores into weights, can be a complex and nuanced process. We have developed two methods that allows for greater flexibility and experimentation: Optimization and Discrete Allocation. These approach enables the exploration of a wide range of potential portfolio compositions.

[Optimization](./optimize.md) capabilities, which is the process of selecting the optimal mix of assets in a portfolio, with respect to the alpha scores, in order to maximize returns while minimizing risk, facilitate the portfolio construction process.

[Discrete Allocation](./discrete_allocation.md) allows the implementation of single or multiple pre-determined rule-based allocation strategies. It builds optimal, high level, diversified portfolios, at scale.
