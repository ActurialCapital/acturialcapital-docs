## Time-series classification 

Time-series classification is a general task that can be useful to identify 
regime change or predefined groups, using labeled training data.

Multi-label classification is a process of categorizing a given set of time
interval data into multiple classes. It requires the machine to learn how to 
assign a class label to examples from the problem domain.

Multi-label classification is a supervised machine learning module that is used 
for classifying time interval data into groups. The goal is to predict the 
categorical class labels. A vast body of research could be implemented, on top 
of pre-processing features that prepare the data for modeling. In python, 
[Pycaret](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#classification) 
has over 18 ready-to-use algorithms and several plots to analyze the 
performance of trained models (e.g. ROC curve, confusion matrix).
