# Phase Identification


> While academics have focused on type I (false positive) and type II errors 
(false negative) for investment strategy development, they have failed to 
analyse changing market conditions. Investors are interested less in knowing the 
statistical significance of their strategies, than in knowing whether their 
strategy will work in the future. Whether it will work in the future is dependent 
on the durability of market conditions which existed while developing it.

*Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2019*.

Phase identification enables investors to more accurately assess economic 
regimes through time, beyond the ongoing switch between market risk-on and off. 
It makes the point of new paradigm for both quant and fundamental PMs, in order 
to identify a cause-effect mechanism to develop a thematic and capturing 
asymmetrical distribution:

* Avoid all-regime strategies (Marcos Lopez de Prado, 2019)
* Allow regime-specific mean and standard deviation estimates

Maximising returns means applying the below dynamic investment approach 
associated with a cycle:

* Contrarian: When the rate of change is null (peak/trough)
    * Long risky assets as they fall
    * Short risky assets as they rise
* Trend-following otherwise (momentum - crowded investment styles)
    * Long risky assets as they rise
    * Short risky assets as they fall

Understanding the balance between the size of the two groups is essential for 
market behaviour:

* When contrarian strategies succeed for a while, they attract followers and 
markets may become too stable (slow to adjust to economic developments)
* Conversely, when momentum strategies succeed for a while, they attract new 
followers and markets may become too volatile (as such overreacting to news flows)

Excess popularity of one approach eventually results in excess gains for the 
opposite style, a process which over time should drive toward a balance. 

!!! note "Long-Term Returns"
    Therefore, long term returns should be positive (negative) only if the 
    overall average cycle trend is upward (downward) sloping. We call this 
    phenomenon Growth or wealth creation (destruction).
