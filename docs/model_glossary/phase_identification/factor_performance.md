The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has 
characterized the development of science. It involves observation and skepticism, 
given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. 
We first tend to identify market and economic regimes with both data 
input and rational methods. We then analyse market performance, through the 
lens of the below groupings:

* GICS [GICS - Global Industry Classification Standard](https://www.msci.com/our-solutions/indexes/gics)
* Risk factors [Factor Performance in Bull and Bear Markets](https://quantpedia.com/factor-performance-in-bull-and-bear-markets/) or [Factorâ€™s Performance During Various Market Cycles](https://quantpedia.com/factors-performance-during-various-market-cycles/), both from QuantPedia
* Network graph, based on correlation or factor similarity (e.g. factor contribution, dominant factor polymodels)
